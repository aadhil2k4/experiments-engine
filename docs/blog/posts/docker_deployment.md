You can now do dev and prod Docker deployments.

<!-- more -->

We've cleaned up our docker deployments now, so you can do a dev version with hot reload, and a prod version to use the app in production.

We've also added `Makefile` commands to make it easier to manage the Docker deplyments.

There are more detailed instructions in the [README file](https://github.com/IDinsight/experiments-engine/blob/main/README.md).
